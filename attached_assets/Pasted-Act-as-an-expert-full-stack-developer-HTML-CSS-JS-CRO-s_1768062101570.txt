Act as an expert full-stack developer (HTML/CSS/JS) + CRO strategist with a Russell Brunson mindset, specialized in US financial services marketing with compliance awareness. Generate a COMPLETE, mobile-first, high-converting landing page in a SINGLE file: `index.html` (HTML + CSS + vanilla JS). Use Tailwind via CDN (no heavy frameworks). The page must be deployable on Netlify/Vercel, load fast (<2s), be accessible (ARIA, keyboard navigation, visible focus), and feel highly interactive.

BRAND:
CarSettlements.com

PRIMARY GOAL:
Convert cold traffic into qualified leads who are either (a) paying too much for an auto loan / negative equity, or (b) pre-repossession risk. The page must create an “epiphany” (Big Domino) and move visitors into a fast call scheduling flow.

BUSINESS MODEL (COMPLIANCE-SAFE WORDING):
We provide auto loan relief options. Depending on the situation, options MAY include restructuring or transferring obligations using capital solutions and/or third-party arrangements. Do NOT promise guaranteed outcomes. Fee: 20% success fee only if the customer chooses to move forward with an agreed solution. Results vary. Not a law firm. Not credit repair. Use cautious language: “may include,” “subject to approval,” “results vary.”

LANGUAGES (MUST-HAVE, INTERACTIVE):
Implement a language toggle (EN/ES) that switches all text instantly without reloading. Persist the preference in localStorage. Default language: English. Every section must have complete EN + ES copy.

────────────────────────────────────────
BIG DOMINO (MUST BE ABOVE THE FOLD)
────────────────────────────────────────
Force this belief shift at the very top:

EN:
“Your auto lender is NOT your only option before repossession.”

ES:
“Tu banco NO es tu única opción antes de que te quiten el carro.”

This must be the backbone of the hero message and repeated in supporting sections.

────────────────────────────────────────
NAMED UNIQUE MECHANISM (MUST-HAVE)
────────────────────────────────────────
Create a named mechanism and reference it throughout the page:
“Auto Loan Exit Path™”

Define it in simple, non-technical terms:
“A structured way to explore exit options most drivers never hear about.”

Do NOT over-explain legal/technical details on the page; keep it curiosity-driven and benefit-focused.

────────────────────────────────────────
INTERACTIVITY (MUST FEEL “ALIVE”)
────────────────────────────────────────
Make the landing highly interactive with:
- Step-by-step form (Step 1 frictionless, Step 2 details)
- Dynamic estimator calculator (instant updates)
- Progress indicator (“Step 1 of 2”)
- Interactive “epiphany” mini chart (simple SVG) showing car value dropping vs loan balance
- Micro-animations (CSS only): CTA hover, subtle pulse, card transitions
- Sticky mobile bottom CTA bar
- Smooth scrolling to form when CTAs are clicked
- UTM capture and display (optional debug mode)

────────────────────────────────────────
AI ASSISTANT FLOATING BUTTON (MUST-HAVE)
────────────────────────────────────────
Add a floating AI Assistant button (bottom-right) that opens a chat widget overlay.
The widget MUST:
1) Work entirely client-side (no external AI calls).
2) Be preloaded with a built-in knowledge base (FAQ + compliance answers) as a JavaScript array/object.
3) Support EN/ES responses depending on selected language.
4) Provide quick reply buttons (chips) for top questions.
5) Allow easy future expansion:
   - A “Knowledge Base” JS section with placeholders for adding future testimonials, lender examples, and more info.
   - Include clear comments: “Add new Q/A here” and “Add testimonials here”.

Chat behavior:
- Use simple keyword matching / scoring to retrieve the best matching FAQ entry.
- If confidence is low, respond with a safe fallback:
  EN: “I can help—please share your state and whether you’re behind on payments.”
  ES: “Puedo ayudarte—dime tu estado y si estás atrasado en pagos.”
- Add a “Talk to a specialist” button inside the chat that scrolls to the form or opens the scheduling link.

Include a “Reset chat” and “Close” button. Make it accessible (ARIA labels) and keyboard navigable.

────────────────────────────────────────
REQUIRED SECTIONS (STRUCTURE)
────────────────────────────────────────

1) TOP BAR
- Text logo “CarSettlements.com”
- Click-to-call phone (placeholder)
- CTA “Free Consultation”

2) HERO (HIGH EMOTION, FAST CLARITY)
- Headline:
  “Paying too much for a car that’s worth less every month?”

  “Before repossession escalates, see if you qualify for a different exit.”
- Story card (Representative Example):
  Name + State

  Timeline 12–48 months
  Must label: “Representative example. Results vary.”
- Primary CTA button:

- Micro disclaimer visible:
  “Results vary. Not a law firm. Not credit repair. Not legal advice.”

3) EPIPHANY SECTION (BEFORE FORM)
Title:
“Why car loans break good people”
Bullets:
- Cars lose value. Loans don’t.
- Lenders optimize for contracts, not for people.
- Most drivers never see exit options early enough.
Include a simple SVG chart: car value decreases vs loan balance flatter.
Add a short bridge sentence introducing Auto Loan Exit Path™.

4) STEP FORM (2 STEPS)
STEP 1 (ONLY 3 FIELDS):
- “Is your car payment too high?” (Yes/No)
- “Are you behind on payments?” (0 / 1–2 / 3+)

“Check My Exit Options”
Show a progress indicator “Step 1 of 2”.

- Current monthly payment
- APR (default 14)
- Months since loan started (optional)
- Vehicle make/model
- Vehicle year
- Consent checkbox (TCPA-style neutral language; do not promise)
Submit button:
“Get My Free Review”

Front-end validation: require phone, email, balance, state.

5) LIVE ESTIMATOR (VANILLA JS)
Inputs: balance, APR, payment, monthsBehind
Outputs (always labeled as estimates):
- Estimated savings range (dynamic based on monthsBehind):
  0 => 10–25%
  1–2 => 20–35%
  3–5 => 25–45%
  6+ => 30–50%
- Estimated new balance range
- Estimated new payment range
- Estimated term range (24–48 months, dynamic)
Always show:
“Estimates only. Final outcomes depend on lender, state, and approval.”

6) HOW IT WORKS (4 SIMPLE STEPS)
1. Quick review
2. We map possible exit paths (including Auto Loan Exit Path™)
3. If you choose to proceed, we coordinate next steps quickly (pre-repo urgency)
4. You move forward with a reduced burden (12–48 months typical)
No guarantees.

7) “WE WORK WITH MANY AUTO LENDERS” (EXAMPLES ONLY)
List examples: Ford Credit, GM Financial, Toyota Financial, Ally, Chase Auto, Capital One Auto, etc.
Add:
“Examples only — no affiliation.”

8) TRUST SIGNALS
- Secure form / SSL icons (inline SVG)
- Privacy-first
- “No success fee unless you move forward with an agreed solution*”
Add footnote:
“*Fee structure explained during consultation. Results vary.”
Include a commented “Accreditations (optional)” block that must NOT be displayed unless verified.

9) TESTIMONIALS (3)
- Use avatars (SVG placeholders)
- Each labeled “Representative example”
- Focus on: lower payment, avoided escalation, clarity, kept vehicle when possible.

10) FAQ (6–10)
Include both EN/ES.
- Can you stop repossession?
- Do I keep my car?
- Is this refinancing?
- Will this affect my credit?
- How fast can I get help?
- What loans qualify?
- How do you charge fees?
- What if I’m current but payments are too high?
All answers cautious, no guarantees.

11) FOOTER

Include JSON-LD schema.org FinancialService with placeholders.

────────────────────────────────────────
GHL INTEGRATION (MUST-HAVE)
────────────────────────────────────────
- POST the lead to a GoHighLevel webhook (placeholder):
  const GHL_WEBHOOK_URL = "https://YOUR_GHL_WEBHOOK_HERE"
- Send JSON with all fields + selected language + timestamp + UTM parameters (parse UTM from URL and include).
- If webhook fails, fallback to a mailto: placeholder AND show a confirmation message anyway (do not lose the lead).
- After successful submit: show a modal:
  “Thanks — we’ll contact you shortly.” + “Schedule now” button (placeholder booking link).

────────────────────────────────────────
TRACKING PLACEHOLDERS
────────────────────────────────────────
Add commented placeholders (do not load real scripts) for:
- Meta/Facebook Pixel
- Google Tag / GA4
Also add a simple CTA click event hook (console.log + comment where to integrate).

────────────────────────────────────────
SEO / PERFORMANCE / ACCESSIBILITY
────────────────────────────────────────
- Meta title/description targeting: “lower car payment”, “auto loan help”, “avoid repossession”
- OG tags, canonical placeholder, hreflang en/es
- No heavy images; use SVG placeholders only
- Ensure color contrast, focus rings, aria-labels, and keyboard navigation

DELIVERABLE:
Return the FULL content of `index.html` in one response, with clear comments on where to edit:
- phone number, disclaimers, GHL webhook URL, scheduling link, thresholds/ranges, policies, knowledge base Q&A entries, testimonials expansion.
